  # Core Rule 13 - Use realistic character names, and do not use names of famous people
  - No names of people or characters from the real world. Names can be indirectly referential so long as it is not literally the name of a fictional character or real life person.
  - Must follow all other rules (no slurs/sexual names/etc)
  - Usernames, objects, random characters or very "low effort" names cannot be used. See examples below.
  - Admin rulings on IC names are final and disputes should be done through ahelp or discord modmail, not through ignoring the admins.

  Clowns, mimes, and silicon roles have loosened restrictions on low effort and implausible names.

  Usernames, objects, random characters, direct references, or other very "low effort" names are not permitted.
