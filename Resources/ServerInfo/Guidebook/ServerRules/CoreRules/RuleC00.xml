  The Server rules are intended to be guidelines and references for good behavior and not ironclad, immovable laws. If YOU believe you have a funny concept going into a round and it toes the line of a server rule, you can try the bit out, but be aware that admins [color=#cb0000]CAN[/color] and [color=#cb0000]WILL[/color] smite you if it isn't actually funny. Be careful!
