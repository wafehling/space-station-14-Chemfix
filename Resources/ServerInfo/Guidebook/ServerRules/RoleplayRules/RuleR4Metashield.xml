  # Roleplay Rule 4 - Do not metagame, obey the Metashield
  Something that is "shielded" cannot be known by your character during a round until the "revealing condition" happens. This also means that your character cannot do things based on "shielded" information. Knowing or acting on something that is shielded before the revealing condition is met is referred to as metagaming.

  Revealing conditions reveal the shielded information for the round, not for a specific instance. This means that once a revealing condition is met in a round, the shield no longer applies in any case for the remainder of the round.

  ## Never Revealed IC
  Some shields are never revealed IC. This means that your character can never act as if they know about that shielded thing.

  The following are shielded:
  - Current game mode and possible antags during the current game mode.
  - Events from previous rounds.
  - Events you experienced as a different character.
  - All information related to the player of a character rather than the character itself. (See [textlink="Rule 4-1. Maintaining relationships between rounds" link="RuleR4-1"])
  - All information gained while dead or a ghost.
  - The fact that a round will end.

  This does not prevent knowing that a shift will end, but does prohibit things like preparing to kill people at central command when roleplay rules stop being enforced on LRP.

  ## MRP Amendment 1
  A shield prevents your character from remembering anything that happened while unconscious. This shield is never revealed IC.

  ## MRP Amendment 2
  There is a "New Life Rule" shield. It prevents you from remembering anything that lead to your death, even if you are put into an MMI. If you are cloned, it also prevents you from remembering everything from that round. This shield is never revealed IC.

  ## Explicitly Not Shielded
  The following is a list of things that are explicitly not shielded. If something is not on this list, it doesn't mean that it is shielded, but if something is on it then it definitely is not shielded.
  - The fact that the nuke disk must be protected and could be used by a bad actor to try to destroy the station.
  - Items that are of high value or are desired by the Syndicate, and therefore are likely targets of theft.
  - The idea that any Syndicate agent or other bad actor has goals or objectives that they are attempting to accomplish.
  - The number of goals or objectives that a Syndicate agent or other bad actor has.
  - The fact that the Syndicate are enemies of Nanotrasen, and that they regularly attempt to send covert agents to spy on, sabotage, or attack Nanotrasen.
  - A character's typical appearance. Though you should keep in mind that multiple characters can share the same name.
  - The fact that the Syndicate have covert items capable of getting items to them, and that these items are known as uplinks.
