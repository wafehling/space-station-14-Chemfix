  The Thaven have a unique brain structure, similar to a positronic brain, and thus have "Moods" which affect them similarly to a borg's Laws. [color=#ffa500]These Moods must be followed to the best of your ability! Treat them like server rules. If a Thaven violates them, they experience distress or discomfort. The specifics of that are up to you, but if a Mood is violated, you must seek to correct your mistake immediately if possible.[/color]

  Thaven Moods can be affected by ionizing radiation, which can have some odd effects on them. Be wary of Ion Storms. (This is currently not implemented.)

  Their unarmed attacks are slow, and deal no damage. However, they do cause a fair amount of stun buildup.

  They take [color=#ffa500]10% more damage from blunt, slash, pierce, and genetic, and 20% more damage from radiation,[/color] but [color=#1e90ff]10% less damage from heat, cold, and poison.[/color]
