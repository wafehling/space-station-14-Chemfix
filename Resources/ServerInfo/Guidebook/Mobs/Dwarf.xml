  Dwarves are similar to humans in most respect, but tolerate alcohol better and are healed by it.

 ## Dwarf Naming Conventions

  Dwarves typically use a first name in their native language and two compound words for their last name, usually noun-noun but verb-noun and adjective-noun are also common.
