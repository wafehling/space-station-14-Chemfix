  They depend on moisture to survive, so anything which contains table salt will damage them when splashed, ingested, or injected (including Saline.)

  They move slower than other species and can't wear shoes, but are unable to be slipped.

  Their shell is very large, and allows them to store two back-slot items. This can be used to gain a ridiculous amount of storage, or to utilize a back-slot jetpack alongside a backpack.

  They take [color=#1e90ff]20% less damage from blunt and slash,[/color] but [color=#ffa500]50% more damage from heat and cold, and 20% more damage from poison.[/color]

  ## Slime Trail

  Using some of the moisture in their body, they can excrete a miraculous substance called "Mucin," which, for unknown reasons, *increases* their walk speed while moving over it. This doesn't seem to work on non-Gastropoids, but perhaps a clever Chemist might be able to change that...
