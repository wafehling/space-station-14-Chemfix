  They have two additional Pocket slots in their inventory. They can eat raw meat without any ill effects, but some foods like chocolate and onion poisons them.
  They suffocate 50% faster, and their Blue Blood can't be metabolised from Iron, being based on Copper instead.

  Their unarmed attacks deal Piercing damage instead of Blunt.

  Arachnids can create Websilk at the cost of getting more hungry. They (and only they) can craft bundles of websilk into various items from clothing and shields to entire walls.
