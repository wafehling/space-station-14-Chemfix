book-text-tegtorial = GUIDE TA THA THERMO-ELECTRIC GENERATOR, OR ‘TEG’

      First thing ta ken abut tha TEG. Ye got two sides, right? Hot, and cold. Each side has gas piped in at an extreme temperature, an’ wen they meet in tha middle ae tha TEG, it makes power. Wen that gas comes outta tha TEG, tha temperature be equalised ae bit, so yer hot gas gets cooler and your cool gas gets hotter. Wi me so far?

      Here be tha tricky bit. Gas follows this cheeky rule: PV = nRT. P be pressure in kPa, V be volume in L. n be tha number ae moles, T be temperature in K, an’ R be some arbitrary number around 8.3.

      So wot’s that mean? Ta dumb it down, tha pressure an’ volume ae gas be tied ta tha amount ae gas an’ tha temperature it be stored at. Tha hotter ae single mole of gas be, tha maer pressure it’ll generate, an’ tha maer volume it’ll take up. Tha inverse be tha same. Cold gas takes up less space an’ generates less pressure.

      If ye’ve e’er dealt wi gas canisters an’ tanks, ye’ll ken they hae an annoying pressure limit ae, like, 4.5mPa, or 4500kPa. Cool yer gas ta ae lower temperature, an’ suddenly that gas will take up less pressure in tha can… an’ ye’ll be able ta fit maer in there. Enjoy nae havin’ ta refill yer oxygen tank every five seconds.

      Ah be bringin’ this up because this be somethin’ ae lot ae people run into wen they’re just startin’ out on tha TEG. They get tha hot an’ cold gas - usin’ tritium fire, plasma, radiators, wot’er method - an’ then out ae nowhere tha TEG up an’ stops. Why? Most likely, tha gas has got so hot that it be producin’ enuf pressure ta choke tha TEG an’ block any maer gas from flowin’ through it.

      This be why ye’ll see ae lot ae modern TEG hot loop designs that use ae pressure relief system. There be lots ae ways ta dae this, from settin’ ae volumetric pump siphonin’ gas out ae tha loop at ae super low rate, ta makin’ ae super-fancy pneumatic valve in tha burn chamber… But really, all ae them hae tha same fundamental idea. Jus’ pop ae passive vent out in space, an’ dump some gas into tha void.

      Sod, ah gotta blather abut tha difference between active and passive vents, tae, huh…? Well, there be ae couple. Tha most important one be backflow, so we’ll start there.

      Why dae we hae pumps in ae gas network? Ta stop backflow. Reckon ae each section ae pipes separated by ae pump as its own pipe network. Gas travels around in ae network instantaneously. Ah’m told it be ae lot like some kind ae ‘red stone’, but ah dinnae hae ae fuckin’ clue wot that means. Maybe ye will. Anyway, pumps transfer gas between networks at ae certain rate dependin’ on whether ye use ae volumetric pump or ae gas pump. Pretty easy difference, volumetric pumps allow gas ta enter at ae specific rate ae L per second, while gas pumps work via pressure.

      Backflow occurs wen gas travels tha WRONG way. Maybe ye’re trying ta fill ae Vox Box wi nitrogen, an’ ye want ta pull oxygen out. In this case, yer backflow wou be tha oxygen ye’re tryin’ ta pull OUT instead bein’ pumped back IN somehow.

      Maybe ah’m being tae technical… Ah dunno if any ae this even makes sense. Anyway, active an’ passive vents both push air into ae room from any pipe that supplies it. Tha difference be that passive vents allow backflow, while active vents dinnae. Sort ae. Really, passive vents will try ta match tha pressure ae tha pipes wi tha pressure ae tha room, an’ it’ll siphon an’ eject gas until it gets that equilibrium. Space has, ye guessed it, nae pressure. So ae passive vent ta space will keep dumpin’ gas because it has nothing in space ta siphon.

      …Eh? Space wind? Nah, that be ae myth. Ah dinnae reckon it exists.

      Active vents be much maer applicable fer day-ta-day use, though, an’ ye’ll see ‘em around tha station. By default, they’ll eject air at ae constant rate ae 101.325kPa (or 1a - a fer atmos!), makin’ it simple ta avoid accidental overpressure incidents in tha halls. But if tha air around them be low enuf pressure, they’ll lock up, an’ stop workin’ - ye’ll see this wen their normally blue lights turn yellow. If ye see ae yellow air alarm, that room’s been spaced. Fuckin’ pay attention ta that shite!

      Wot wis ah blatherin’ abut? Right, right, tha TEG…

      …Well, jus’ figure it out, or somethin’… Space yer radiators fer ae cold loop, git yer ratio ae 99 oxygen ta 1 plasma an’ burn it fer ae tritium fire… Make sure distro be at ae ratio ae 22 oxygen ta 78 nitrogen… Sod, wen did this go from ae TEG guide ta an instruction manual fer babies…?
